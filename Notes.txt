Note: these notes are to the best of my memory
Friday Jan 22nd
  -I am cleaning up the code and putting it into functions 
  -I converted time series into the total time since an arbitray date and into categories for the years days and months
  -DId a one hot encoding of the categorical variables and combined it with the time data
  -converted the target column into numbers and combined it with the existing data. 
  -used the module sklearn to perform a naive bayes classifier on the data. 
  -A three-fold cross validation was performed and it returned around 60%
  -using the pipeline function in sklearn different feature enginerering techniques were applied
Saturday jan 23rd
  -I tried runnnig the classifier with different ways of dealing with the missing values. When I impput -1 for each nan the best 
  -score was achieved. I also tried droping all rows with nan's and all columns with nan's neither produced good scores. 
  -when i try to use the model on the test data i get an error about the number of columns not matching up. 
  -during the one hot encoding there are not the same number of levels in the columns so it produces frames with different num    of columns
  -to fix this i'll combine the test and train data and then perform the one hot encoding. 
Sunday jan 24th
-I created bar charts of the female and male split on country preference
-i created plots for the country destinations, gender, age, and time. pandas has a wrapper for matplotlibs plot function which   is handy
Saturday jan 9th
- I used the pandas datareader to examine the info they have from the world  bank. The data is split up by different indicators
-You can get data between now and 1960. I explored how complete these dates were. There are about 150 countries so I set the     limit at 50 per date. 
Sunday jan 10th
-I used the requests and lxml modules to access a website and I parsed the xml tree to see where the data I wanted was
-then i put the data into a list to use with an api.  
monday jan 11th
-found all the xls links on a webpage, retrieved one of them and used pandas import excel to put it into a dataframe
-opened an excel link from consumer finance. 
-opened a weather channel csv and used pandas to get it into a dataframe
-opened a zipfile using zipfile, there is also gzip and one other format. THe file was from the machine learning database
Thursday Jan 14th
-used the world bank indicator to get categories on the countries and spplit these up based on region
-i included nan's instead of numbers for this
-made a pandas cross tab of, which is usefull for seeing the layout of two categroical variables
-made  a histogram of the income,admin,region,lending type. 
Monday February 8th
-I want to make a submission so i've got to go through what i have and pull one together. 
-i'd like to keep work on these going. and use deep learning somehow.
